# Android Clipboard Copier
So in some OS there's no "Copy to Clipboard" button in **Share** menu for some reason. This little thing adds it to there.

## Implementation
There are only 2 important files - `AndroidManifest` and `MainActivity`.

## Note
App is installed but cannot be launched. It will only add option into the **Share** menu to copy text to clipboard.
